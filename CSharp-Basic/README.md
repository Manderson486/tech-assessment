# Hey developers, engineers, hackers. 
**This is important!** We want to respect your valuable time so **_PLEASE_** timebox this exercise.

Your current mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take a few (no more than two) hours to build an Orders REST API endpoint. We have created some starter templates for a few languages but you don't need to use them if you would prefer to roll your own.

## What we would like to see from this exercise:
* Create order endpoint
* List all orders by customer endpoint
* Update order endpoint
* Cancel order endpoint
* Tests to prove your code works as expected

## How to interact with this activity:
1. Fork the main tech-assessment repository
2. Complete the activities above to the best of your ability
3. Provide a link to the completed exercise to Jenny Hove [jenny.hove@sogeti.com]
4. Receive personalized code review/feedback session from our technical team

## Things to keep in mind
1. Use the language you are best and most comfortable with. If you are not comfortable with C#, please use your best language.
2. We are generally looking for the following criteria: Code compiles and works as expected and design patterns / SOLID principles are used.
3. If this exercise seems too easy, consider the Advanced C# exercise.
