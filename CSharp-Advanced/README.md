## What we would like to see from this exercise:
The advanced exercise will provide you with a base API and we are hoping to see what you think may be pertinent changes. 

Before you begin:
* Provide a code review for this API in written form

Then, implement what you can from your review being mindful of not going over 2 hours. If you run out of time, feel free to make notes on what else remains. 
* How do you apply SOLID principles to this API?
* How do consumers easily discover this API?
* What can you do to ensure future code changes do not break existing domain expectations?
* What are some design methods to keep your API from introducing breaking changes which may cause problems to your consumers?

We are generally looking for the following criteria: Clean/SOLID code, data persistence, performant and scalable, and tested.
